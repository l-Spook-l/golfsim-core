## üìñ About the Project
**GolfSim** is a golf simulator with shot analysis and statistics visualization.  
The system consists of a **desktop application** and a **mobile client**:

- The mobile app tracks the ball by color and detects the moment of impact.  
- The shot video is transmitted over the local network to the PC.  
- The desktop app analyzes ball speed, launch angle, and calculates distance using [FlightScope Trajectory](https://trajectory.flightscope.com/) (a stub implementation is included; you can integrate your own service or calculations).  
- Shot results are displayed in a sortable and filterable table.  

üì± Mobile app: [GolfSim Mobile](https://github.com/l-Spook-l/golfSim-mobile)  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The distance between the camera and the ball must be **50 cm** for accurate tracking.
